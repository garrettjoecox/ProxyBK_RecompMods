# ToggleTrot
Makes Talon Trot toggleable instead of hold-to-run

If you release Z within the first 10 frames of the toggle trot, you will not stop trotting 
until you press and release Z again. If you hold Z for longer than 10 frames, releasing Z will
stop the trot immediately like the original behavior.
